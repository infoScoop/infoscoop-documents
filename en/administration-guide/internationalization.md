## 2 Internationalization of Messages

### 2.1 Available Components

The following components can be internationalized.

  * Menu
  * Search form
  * Other Layout (and header)
    * Title
    * Content footer
    * JavaScript Customize
  * Gadget
  * infoScoop OpenSource (I18N Messages used in infoScoop can not be internationalized.)

### 2.2 Applicable Rules of the Locale

I18N messages should be provided for each locale.  
A locale represents a combination of the language that user use and country.

e.g. ja (Japanese) / jp (Japan), en (English) / US (USA)

Locale is determined by comparing the string of "Accpect Language" header which is sent by browser.  
The first language in the settings is used if multiple languages is specified in the language settings of browser.  
Locale is compared in order of language and country.  
The Language of the default setting `ALL (default)`, Country `ALL (default)` is applied if the locale to be applied is not set in the `Accept-Language` header.  
Also, the order of settings does not affect anything as the available languages and countries are unique.

### 2.3 CSV Files for Internationalization Messages

I18N messages are managed by importing / exporting CSV files encoded in `Shift_JIS (MS932/Windows-31J)` format.  
CSV file format for internationalized messages basically conforms to RFC4180.  
Message contents is described in order of `Key of i18n messages (alphanumeric and underscore '_', maximum of 512 bytes), Resource messages (2048 bytes)` in the CSV file.

e.g. "TodoList_title", "TODO list"

The following case occurs an error.

  * An empty key in i18n message.
  * An empty message.
  * If the i18n messages including the key that does not exist in ALL_ALL locale is imported to the locale other than ALL_ALL locale.

**Note:** The messages which is exist in ALL_ALL locale but not in added locale will be complemented by messages in ALL_ALL locale.
