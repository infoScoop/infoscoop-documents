# Gadget Settings

This section explains how to manage gadgets.

## 1 What Is Gadget?

A gadget is a window like panel placed in a page of infoScoop OpenSource, and it is a basic unit that makes up users' page.

## 2 Gadget vs. Widget

A unit placed in a screen of infoScoop is called gadget or widget.  
Gadget and widget are used interchangeably in infoScoop, but they are defined as follows.

### 2.1 About Gadget

Strictly, a gadget is a part that made with old version of Google Gadget API specification or a part made with OpenSocial API specification.

**Note:** Latest infoScoop only supports Gadget Core API of OpenSocial API.

To use a gadget, register it in the repository database of infoScoop OpenSource, or call it directly from inside or outside of company's web server.

**Note:** If a gadget from outside of company's network is used, pay attention to unauthorized access from it to the other gadgets and infoScoop because the gadget is operated as a content within the same domain server that infoScoop is deployed.

To solve this problem, the gadgets not registered in infoScoop must be operated in a different domain. For details, refer to <a href="properties-settings.md#9_2_gadgetProxyURL">9.2 gadgetProxyURL</a>.

### 2.2 About Widget

A widget is a part that can be used only in infoScoop.  
The frequently used common parts such as RSS reader and Schedule are optimized for the infoScoop server.  
Widgets are referred to as "Built-in Gadgets" in Administration page.

## 3 Gadget Placement and Corresponding Administration Page

Gadget placement of users' page and the corresponding Administration pages are as follows.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Place</th><th>Corresponding Administration Page</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Top Menu</td>
            <td><b>Menu</b> Administration Page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Side Menu</td>
            <td><b>Menu</b> Administration page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Command Bar</td>
            <td><b>Layout</b> - <b>Default Screen</b> administration page - <b>commandbar</b> tab</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fixed Area</td>
            <td><b>Layout</b> - <b>Default Screen</b> Administration page - <b>tab (tub number)</b> tab - Fixed Area settings</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Personalized Area</td>
            <td><b>Layout</b> - <b>Default Screen</b> Administration page - <b>tab (tab number)</b> tab - Personalized Area settings</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## 4 Default Values of User Settings and Application

Each gadget has user's setting values (UserPref). (According to the gadget specification, module settings are written in XML, and user's settings are written in /Module/UserpPref element.)  
A gadget is initially placed from Menus or Default Screen settings, and the default values applied to UserPrefs are from the values configured in Administration page.  
The default values of user's setting are configured in as follows.

  * Gadget settings (Administration page)
  * Menu settings (Administration page)
  * User settings (setting panel of dropped gadget)

If a gadget is added from Menu, the order of priority to apply the default value of user's setting is as follows.

  1. The value configured in Gadget settings (Administration page)
  2. The value configured in Menu settings (Administration page)
  3. The value configured in User settings (setting panel of dropped gadget)

Shortly, the values configured in Menu settings are updated by default values at first, and the UserPrefs configured in Gadget settings and Menu settings are all copied if a gadget is added to the screen at second. Finally, UserPrefs except for URL cannot be edited in Administration page.  
The default value of a UserPref with "hidden" datatype cannot be edited in Gadget Administration page. (A user's setting that the datatype attribute of UserPref element is "hidden" is defined as an item that users cannot edit.)  
The default value of a UserPref with "hidden" datatype can be edited in gadget settings page in Menu or Default Screen Administration page.


## 5 Gadget Administration Page

To show Gadget setting page, select **Gadget** in Administration page.  
Common settings of each gadget and the default values of properties that users can edit, are configured in Gadget setting page.  
In addition, gadgets are added and initially configured in this page as well.  
The list of Built-in Gadgets is initially hidden. Click the header to show or hide the list.

### 5.1 Gadget Settings

The selected gadget is highlighted and the item edited is shown on the right side if a gadget is selected from Gadget list.

If it is a gadget, the attribute value of Module/ModulePrefs is to be edited.  
However, `title`, `title_url`, `directory_title`, `height`, and `singleton` are the only attributes that can be edited.

#### 5.1.2 Editing User Settings (Default Values)

The default values of gadget user's settings are configured in **User settings (default value)**.  
If it is a gadget, the attribute value of Module/ModulePrefs@default_value is to be edited.

### 5.2 Adding and Modifying a Gadget

To add (upload) a gadget to infoScoop server, specify a gadget configuration XML file or a compiled ZIP file including a gadget configuration file, release bundles, css files etc.  
The gadget configuration file must be placed directly under the unzipped root directory if it is a ZIP file.  
The name of ZIP file without extension must be used for the gadget configuration file name with XML extension.  
For example, here is a ZIP file which contains the unzipped directory as follows.

C:\Hello  
|_Hello.xml  
|_ALL_ALL.xml  
|_ja_ALL.xml

If Hello.zip is unzipped, Hello.xml is considered as a gadget configuration file.  
Each uploaded files can be accessed with relative paths from their assigned URLs. The URL that a gadget file is placed is defined as `__IS_GADGET_BASE_URL__`.

In the above case, ALL_ALL.xml is written in the gadget configuration file as follows.

    <Locale messages="__IS_GADGET_BASE_URL__/ALL_ALL.xml"/>

## 7 Supplements

<a name="displayInlineHost"></a>
### 7.1 Property displayInlineHost

This is the property to configure the operation when `Auto detect` is specified in content display mode.  
In content display mode, `Frame in portal` is applied if the URL of the link includes one of the host names from "displayInlineHost" property, otherwise `New window` is applied.  
For example, specify `aaa` and `bbb` to displayInlineHost to show the website whose host name is `aaa` or `bbb` in Frame in portal even if overall setting is `New window`.  
In this case, the web page like `http://aaa/hoge.html` is shown in Frame in portal, and the web page like `http://ccc/foo.html` is shown in a new window.

<a name="date-format"></a>
