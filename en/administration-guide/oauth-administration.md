# OAuth Administration

A setup and the management method about OAuth and OAuth related specification are explained.

## 1 About OAuth

OAuth is that service (consumer) for mush-up makes it attest directly with service (service providers) for mush-up, without receiving a user's id and password directly, and is the specification which enables acquisition of required data.  
infoScoop OpenSource corresponds to a consumer.

Moreover related to OAuth, infoScoop OpenSource corresponds to the Signed Request which is the specification of OpenSocial.

OAuth settings of infoScoop OpenSource are needed if a gadget uses OAuth or signed request on infoScoop OpenSource.

Refer to the contents of this page and setup each required settings to use these gadgets.

## 2 About the OAuth Setting Method And Its Management Function

In order to use an OAuth gadget on infoScoop OpenSource, there are the following two methods.

  1. The gadget corresponding to OAuth is uploaded to infoScoop OpenSource.
  2. The gadget corresponding to OAuth in an external server is used.

Registration of the information on the OAuth gadget in an external server is performed from the **OAuth** management function of an infoScoop OpenSource administration page.

The following is explanation about the details of **OAuth** administration page.

## 3 OAuth Administration Page

An OAuth administration is opened by clicking **OAuth** from the menu of the upper part of Administration page.  
On this page, OAuth and Signed Request can be configured.  
The OAuth administration consists of **Consumer Settings** and **Container's Certificate**.  
This clause explains **Consumer Settings** tab and a **Container's Certificate** tab.

### 3.1 Consumer Settings

In order to use an OAuth gadget, it is necessary to add a setting of the gadget by **Consumer Settings**.

#### 3.1.1 Context Menu

The context menu of OAuth administration page is explained below.

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### 3.1.2 Add item

The OAuth setting item of a gadget can be added by clicking the ![Add icon] **Add** button at the upper left of the **Consumer Settings** page.  
A modal window is shown to setup the consumer setting.

### 3.2 Container's certificate

In order to use the OAuth gadget using **RSA-SHA1** form, and **Signed Request**, a setup with **Container's certificate** is required.

The certificate set up here is used in order to verify creation of the signature added to the request to a service provider, and the signature which the service provider received.

Therefore, it is necessary to provide a service provider with a consumer key and a public key.  
Don't open to the public in addition to a service provider.

Moreover, although the sample is set up in the state of the first stage, Be sure to change a consumer key, a secret key, and a public key. Don't change these three setting items after a setup in principle.  
Because a service provider is provided with consumer key and public key as above-mentioned, if a setup is changed after offer, there is a possibility that it may become impossible to use service.
